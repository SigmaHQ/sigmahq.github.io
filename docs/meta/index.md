# Sigma {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Sigma Meta rules are an **extension** of the Sigma detection format. They allow for the definition of more advanced detection techniques, such as [**correlations**](/docs/meta/correlations) and [**filters**](/docs/meta/filters).

## Defining Meta Rules

Meta rules are defined in the same way as Sigma rules, but with a few special reserved words used in place
of `detection`.

```yaml
title: Sigma Rule Title
detection: // [!code --]
    selection:
        EventID: 4625
    condition: selection
```

[Sigma Correlations](/docs/meta/correlations) are designated by the special `correlation` keyword. Sigma Correlations allow you to write more sophisticated and targeted detections by combining and analyzing relationships between events.

```yaml
status: test
correlation: // [!code ++] // [!code focus:10]
    type: event_count
    rules:
        - failed_logon
    group-by:
        - TargetUserName
        - TargetDomainName
    timespan: 5m
    condition:
        gte: 10
level: medium
```

And [Sigma Filters](/docs/meta/filters) are designated by the special `filter` keyword. Sigma Filters allow you to filter out common false-positive detections and build sets of exclusions to start to tune Sigma rules for your own organisation.

```yaml
status: test
filter: // [!code ++] // [!code focus:8]
    rules:
        - failed_logon
    selection:
        # Filter out Domain Controllers
        ComputerName|startswith: 'DC-'
    condition: not selection
level: low
```

## Referencing in Meta Rules

Both [Sigma Correlations](/docs/meta/correlations) and [Sigma Filters](/docs/meta/filters) require you to reference an existing regular Sigma Rule. This is done by using
the `rules` keyword underneath the `correlation` or `filter` section.

This pattern allows you to reference an existing rule either by using it's `name` or `id`.

```yaml
filter:
  rules:
    - failed_logon # Referencing by name
    - df0841c0-9846-4e9f-ad8a-7df91571771b # Referencing by ID
```

::: warning Global References

When converting Sigma rules, it's important to remember that Sigma Correlations and Sigma Filters can reference any Sigma rule â€“ not just those within the same file.

However, it is important to supply the rule at conversion time to ensure that the Sigma Correlation or Sigma Filter can be applied correctly.
